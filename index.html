      <p class="text-muted"> This place is AWESOME!! Nice friendly people and SO MANY cool animal's to see. And if your a veteran and you show your military ID. You get in free which I thought was so great. They had a awesome bird show that I actually enjoyed very much. Overall it's a wonderful place to bring your family and get to see and experience animals that you would not normally see. This is a Must SEE and a will be going back again very soon!!</p>

      <hr>

      <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">i had visited in sept 2019</h5>

      <p class="text-muted"> Quaint little restaurant tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu. Blink and you will miss the entrance to the cafe. So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are on the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The food is delicious, the servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring celebrities on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointments. On other days, the crowd there is pretty hep & happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest", which you must attend if possible.</p>

        <p>Where to begin, where to begin! You know a movie is outstanding when the end credits alone are more epic than the majority of films released in the last 20 years! This film is the pure definition of an emotional roller coaster and throughout it's run time brings about fascination, humor, sadness, incredible excitement, and sheer finality. This is not your typical superhero movie and some viewers used to the entertaining, nonstop action style of the previous films may be disappointed, but I think that this movie brilliantly satisfies and subverts expectations. You should definitely watch the other Marvel Movies because the storyline is based on the storyline of the other movies. </p>

        <p>This is a movie that pulled my heart strings and tugged my emotions hard. Its all about moving on from missery and finding peace, a new hero for Wakanda and its been a long time since we have had a marvel movie where the plot is to protect earth instead of just a certain person or small area of the world. The last Marvel Movie with this plot was Endgame and to be honest this is the best marvel movie since endgame and No Way Home. I came in with low exspectations and got more than i exspected. This was better than the first movie from a long shot and there message to step up and be the new hero or role model when someones no longer there was wondeful. </p>
